Next Steps
==========

There is a lot more to [discover in AQL](../../AQL/index.html) and much more
functionality that ArangoDB offers. Continue reading the other chapters and
experiment with a test database to foster your knowledge.

If you want to write more AQL queries right now, have a look here:

- [Data Queries](../../AQL/DataQueries.html): data access and modification queries
- [High-level operations](../../AQL/Operations/index.html): detailed descriptions
  of `FOR`, `FILTER` and more operations not shown in this introduction
- [Functions](../../AQL/Functions/index.html): a reference of all provided functions
